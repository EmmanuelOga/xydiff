default install: be sure to have Xerces installed.

-Fix the Xerces, ICU and GCC path in the following files:
      -Make.xydiff 
      -AUTOTEST_AFTER_BUILD.sh
-Make sure that Xerces and Icu have been compiled with the same version of gcc (gcc2 vs gcc3) that you use for XyDiff
      -The lib&include directories must be found in the Xercesc and ICU path
      -The bin, lib and include directories for gcc must be accessible

Then just type:

gmake all

Good luck!
